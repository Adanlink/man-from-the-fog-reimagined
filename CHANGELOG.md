- A lot of refactoring has been done
    - Including a whole new state system (doesn't change gameplay, just easier to add new states now)
- The Man now breaks glass blocks in 1 block radius around him
- Fixed bug where if a hallucination despawns, the chase theme restarts
- Made The Man's ambient sounds quieter and more muffled
- Added an "alarm" screech when The Man begins a chase
- The Man can now either chase, flee or disappear on the spot when stared at for too long
