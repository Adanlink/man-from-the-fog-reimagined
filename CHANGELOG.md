- Removed player's having infinite hunger when being chased
  - Replaced by capping player's hunger at 8 and them being exhausted when the chase stops
- Added fog
- Made fences, fence gates, slabs and stairs climbable for The Man
- New gamerule : manShouldHungerBeCapped, true by default, if false, player's hunger won't be capped while chased
- Slowed down The Man's attacks

Sorry for being silent for 4 months, I've been working on a game and y'know how it goes, I'll try to focus more on MFTFR.
