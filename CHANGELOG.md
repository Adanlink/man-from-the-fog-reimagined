- Tweaked animations a little bit
- The Man will now break blocks in front of him if it's the shortest path (don't worry, he respects the doMobGriefing gamerule and he doesn't break valuables and containers)
- The ambient sound now also plays when The Man spawns
- Tweaked default game rules' values, so The Man spawns a little bit more often
- The Man's lunge force is now lower, so he can now more accurately aim at players (at least that's what I think it does lol)
