- Fixed The Man's pathfinding being weird when target's Y coordinate is bigger than The Man's Y coordinate
- Scrapped the pathfinding climb system in favor of a much more reliable system
- Fixed chase theme not looping seamlessly
- Changed the package name from `com.zen.fogman` to `com.zen.the_fog`

If any crashes/bugs occur, please make a GitHub Issue or post it in my Discord server, I didn't experience any crashes while testing, there's a small chance they may occur for you, but there are chances nonetheless. (Maybe because I changed the package name)
