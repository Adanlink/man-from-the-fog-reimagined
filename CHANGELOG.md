I also wanted to thank you guys for the insane support, ~16.5k downloads in just 6-8 months is genuinely insane, I have crunched this update and haven't slept for hours just to make sure it feels right and that it doesn't have any glitches and bugs, however if you still find some, please report them in Github Issues or my Discord server.
